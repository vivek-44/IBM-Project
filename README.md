# üîå Power System Fault Detection & Classification using Machine Learning

## üìò Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based approach for detecting and classifying faults in power distribution systems. Using electrical phasor data (voltage and current), the system can identify and categorize fault types such as:

- Line-to-Ground (L-G)
- Line-to-Line (L-L)
- Three-Phase Faults (L-L-L)
- Normal Operation

The solution uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on historical phasor measurements and is deployed using **IBM Cloud** for real-time inference and fault monitoring.

## üí° Problem Statement

Modern power systems are highly sensitive to faults that may lead to equipment failure, power outages, and reduced reliability. Traditional rule-based fault detection methods often lack the speed and adaptability required in dynamic grid environments.

There is a need for an intelligent, automated system that:
- Detects faults rapidly and accurately
- Classifies fault types using real-time data
- Scales effectively with modern grid technologies
